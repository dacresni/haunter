# HAUNTER!
Can you out run the ghost?

## Story
You are living the American Dream. You just bought a house from a realtor, but what they didn't tell you was of the previous occupants who are still the current occupants since the only moving they did was to the ethereal plain.

These ghost are not Alec Baldwin and Gina Davis from *Beetlejuice*.  They're more like the *13 Ghost* kind of ghouls. The murderous hack-and-slash kind.

However, there is a clause in your contract. In the event that the realtor sold you a lemon, you have until the end of the week to get your stuff and tell the realtor about it...if you can survive and get your stuff out of the house first, otherwise you're stuck with it.

## Goal of the game

* Get your stuff out of the house.
* Collect evidence of the realtor's shame.
* Dodge the ghosts back to your car.
* Don't die.

## Longer story

> (Note: This part is long. I would not recommend reciting it as part of the 2 minute presentation.)

This part of got long. So I moved it [here](./haunter-godot/fullbackstory.md)


## Characters

* **Thaddeus McCork (the antagonist)** - shredded into an unknown number of parts, Mad McCork is more than one ghost. He's a bunch of them!  You must avoid him at all cost.
* **Maximilian Stamp** - The realtor, he apparently left a whole bunch of tapes lying around the building, mostly audio. You don't want to see the video.  Grifting people for years, the apple didn't fall far from the tree.  You must collect the tapes for bonuses as Stamp knew more about the ghost than he supposedly let on.
* **Curtis Williams (the protagonist)** - A real American hero who just wanted to have some peace only to be hoodwinked by a shady realtor, even after supporting his plans to make the state great again.

## The goal
* Get all your stuff out of the house.
* Find all the incriminating evidence.
* Make it to your car.
* Did I mention Don't Die?
