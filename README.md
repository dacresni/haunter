# HAUNTER!
Can you out run the ghost?

## Story
You are living the American Dream. You just bought a house from a realtor, but what they didn't tell you was of the previous occupents who are still the current occupants since the only moving they did was to the ethreal plain.

These ghost are not Alec Baldwin and Gina Davis from *Beetlejuice*.  They're more like the *13 Ghost* kind of ghouls. The murderous hack-and-slash kind.

However, there is a clause in your contract. In the event that the realtor sold you a lemon, you have until the end of the week to get your stuff and tell the realtor about it...if you can survive and get your stuff out of the house first, otherwise you're stuck with it.

## Goal of the game

* Get your stuff out of the house.
* Collect evidence of the realtor's shame.
* Dodge the ghosts back to your car.
* Don't die.

## Longer story

England 1823, Charles Babbage is given 1700 pounds to start working on the difference engine No.1 with the industrialist Joseph Clemet and mathmatician Ada King, the Countess of Lovelace.  It is in this time, the Industrial Remvolution was midway between the Madness of King George and the Reign of Queen Victoria.

But inbetween this layover, a forgotton inventor, one who was erased from history because his plans and his beliefs were so obscure, so outlandish, that Queen Victoria ordered the Royal Library to redact information of his occult activities.

The name of this mystic inventor was Thaddeus McCork.

McCork had spend his own money to travel the world to find a link between the metaphysical and the techonological, a bridge between the most fringe cults and the most fringe science.

McCork was banish to America after claming he invented the monkey's paw after and then used it to wished for the Irish Potato Famine.  It didn't help that the boat they sent him on was filled with the very people whose land he had blighted.  Or that he would spend his days in America tossing rats into a meat grinder to be sold as consumable meat.  It really didn't help him when on day, he was given an order to deliver his malevolent meat to the basement of New England's most peculiar collector of large meat grinders after an ice storm where the homeowner left the door unlocked.  Of course, he didn't die falling into meat grinders, but the room was filled with enough flour mill dust that the room exploded when he lit a match.

The building McCork entered was part of an underground cornmeal smuggling ring, where the combustable dust not only leveled the block, but shredded him with a copious amount of shrapnel in the process.  It was like being in a room full of pipe bombs and no place to take cover.

When the towns volunteer fire brigade had finally quenched the fire, they found a skull with part of a meat grinder lodged into the top of it, like it was the hat the Pope wears.

But his soul was trapped on the property. Screaming until one day new property owners build a multilevel high rise on top of it, unaware of the spector anchored to the location.  Which brings us to the current tennant: Maximillion Stamp.

Stamp was the northeast's most successful reator, but nobody knew the dark side of his empire. His father once was a slumlord who kick out people felt privy to discriminate against.  His life was posh and privledge. And for years, he was making vacant property sell again.

The latest person to be suckered into buying one of his more scrulous properties was Curtis Williams, a war veteran looking for some peace.  It seemed like an abandon building would be ideal for calming his nerves and PTSD.  The nearest neighbor was two blocks in either direction.

So to have the peace of his own building and to acquire it in a foreclosure with his salary was something he could not pass up...or at least he thought.

Soon Curtis would start to hear voices.  Not the voice of someone who had witnessed the horrors of war but more like chains and slow grinding noises, like if somebody had tossed an entire fish into a blender set at a slow speed.

He checked the building for gas leaks. He made a visit to his doctor to make sure that he wasn't going crazy. He even made set a trap in by chance it was a local vagrant hiding in the house.

What he didn't expect was the manifestation of a seven foot tall ghost covered in rusty scrap metal and whose gate made a thunderous clanging sound.

Ka-lang. Ka-lang. ***WWWWWWWWRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!***

It was the ghost of Mad McCork! 

But wait, Curtis had a though during his moment of panic, and it was something he remembered that was part of the contract.  If he didn't get his belongings out of the haunted tower, which had been scattered throughout the domicile, by midnight, he would be stuck owning the building.  What worse!  Stuck with a homicidial ghost covered in fused rusty metal...a sight that even in two tours in Iraq he never saw such a terrible sight, and there was much he didn't want to tell anybody about because it was wanton enough.

You are Curtis Williams, you must collect your nerves and collect your things and especially the deed to the building and make it to the parking garage without being grinded up by the vile apparition that was not mentioned at the real estate office so that you can crash the realtors new venture: running for governor on a platform of lies.

If you don't get out before time is up, the ghost will drag you to the sub basement where the furnance is.
