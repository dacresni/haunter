Change is inevidable. This document should help track the changes that Git/GitHub can't express in a simple commit message.

## 2019.01.27 by jrcharney

Just a short list of structural file changes

* The following list of files have been moved into the `haunter-godot` directory.
    - `antag-1.png`
    - `DoorDown.png`
    - `DoorUp.png`
    - `Floor.png`
    - `twowaycycle.png` (this file needs to be fixed anyway. Spirtes are too close together and for some reason event when were going right, when you stop the character facts left again.)
* Several lines have been commented out in `haunter.html` since we aren't using them for now.  These were necessary to eliminate the 404 Not Found errors. 
* To be clear, when I was talking about coding the ghost path, I mean the ghost path in [this CodePen example](https://codepen.io/jrcharney/pen/roJdde) that is one of our diversifiers.
* Also when I was talking about the Bob-ombs from Super Mario, I didn't mean we needed to have bombs in the game.

**REMEMBER: K.I.S.S.! (<u>K</u>EEP <u>I</u>T <u>S</u>IMPLE, <u>S</u>TUPID!)**
