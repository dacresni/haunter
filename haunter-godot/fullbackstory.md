# The Tale of Mad McCork.
written by Jason Charney

> Note: This is not a full story. It is the back story. My idea is that the end of this game ends not with good triumphing over evil but good discovering evil already won, but it will be up to good people like him to outlast the evil until a time where the forces of good take control...or at least realizes their plan which never was that good to begin.  There's all sorts of politics in this, but I will hold my tongue. Enjoy the story.

England 1823, Charles Babbage is given 1700 pounds to start working on the difference engine No.1 with the industrialist Joseph Clement and mathematician Ada King, the Countess of Lovelace.  It is in this time, the Industrial Revolution was midway between the Madness of King George and the Reign of Queen Victoria.

But in between this layover, a forgotten inventor, one who was erased from history because his plans and his beliefs were so obscure, so outlandish, that Queen Victoria ordered the Royal Library to redact information of his occult activities.

The name of this mystic inventor was Thaddeus McCork.

McCork had spend his own money to travel the world to find a link between the metaphysical and the technological, a bridge between the most fringe cults and the most fringe science.

McCork was banish to America after claiming he invented the cursed monkey's paw, used it to bribe parliament for 1 million quid, then claimed that he used it to wished for the Irish Potato Famine (which was actually an ongoing blight at the time).  It didn't help his plans to bribe the government failed, so before he could find his head on a pike, he hopped on the first boat to America unaware that  that the boat he was on was filled with the very people who he publicly claimed that he used magic to blight their land.

It also didn't help that when he got to America, the only job he could get was for a discount butcher where his employer instructed him to spend his days making deliveries and to secretly spend his days tossing rats into a meat grinder to be sold as consumable meat.  (Aren't you glad we have the FDA now?)

It really didn't help him when on one day, he was given an order to deliver his malevolent meat to the basement of New England's most peculiar collector of large meat grinders just after a severe ice storm where it looked as if the homeowner left the door unlocked. He slipped on the ice, skidded down the stairs and--now hold on, it's not what you think happened next. He survived the spill down the stairs. He didn't die falling into a meat grinder, a bunch of meat grinders, or even a human-sized meat grinder.  That last one didn't even exist at the time.

He survived the spill...just not the explosion.

What did exist was an underground smuggling ring where items were being bartered illicitly for trade.  This specific house wasn't in the business of selling unmarked deli meats, but a transnational flour smuggling ring.  Flour is made from grain, and harvested grain is usually stored in silos where the air must maintain a certain condition such that the humidity isn't so low that the dust particles that are kicked up don't cause a chain reaction as of the result of static electricity.  Electricity was still a relatively new concept at the time.

However, the room that McCork was in was so dry, and not suitable for the storage of a wet bail of hay let alone dried dusty wheat, that when McCork struck a match to find his bearings in hopes to find a near by candle wick to illuminate the room, he and everything in it suddenly were engulfed in a ball of fire so combustible, that the explosion would level not just that building but every building on the block.

Worsening his predicament, the collection of meat grinders that were being used to grind the wheat with a copious amount of cornmeal (also being illegally traded and also combustible under improper storage) which was stored under each table full of scrupulous milling devices which became the tools that would shred his already screaming burning carcass with an immeasurable amount of shrapnel tearing his soul apart.  It was like being in a room full of pipe bombs and no place to take cover.

When the town's volunteer fire brigade finally quenched the fire almost two days later, they found a skull with part of a meat grinder lodged into the cranium, like it was the hat the Pope wears.

What the town didn't know that his practice of the dark arts had only abetted in his eternal suffering, as the soul fragments had become independent of each other turning one cursed soul into thousands of cursed souls anchored to the same single entity but bound to the property upon its division was made possible.

For decades over the next few centuries, the soul gremlins would slowly assemble themselves back together but claim the souls of other victims in the process whenever a new property was being constructed upon it.  Redacted from public record were the number of injuries and especially deaths of other people some of whom had their souls taken by the ghost of Mad McCork in the hopes that with each new damnation would bring the felonious phantom closer to reassembly when their souls were grinded into ghost glue.  Stuck together and stitched with threads made from human hair the legend of Mad McCork's ghost would be passed on through history as a campfire tale told at summer camp to the gossip that spinsters would sometimes mention at their bridge club to amuse themselves with.

However the story was told, it eventually became urban legend, and more people replaced their make-believe superstitions with scientific facts which would claim that ghosts aren't real and that the land that for one cursed soul time forgot was not entrapped within the boundaries of the property.  The modernization of philosophy rejected the wailing in the night was that of a soul screaming in an endless hell being torn apart everyday or that its everyday activities were to inflict the same painful tortures upon the many collected souls he spun into thread or adhesive.

This would seem to go on for the longest time until one day new property owners build a multilevel high rise on top of it, unaware of the spectre anchored to the location.  Which brings us to the current tenant: Maximilian Stamp.

Stamp was the northeast's most successful realtor, a bullish man who was obsessed with winning that even when he lost he would claim that those stories were made up despite there being plenty of physical evidence and recorded transcripts, audio tapes, and video documenting every wrong he ever did. Every bad word said about him, every court record against him, every tangible piece of evidence that stated he was not the charismatic charmer he projected that he was was in fact a smoke screen to cover up the number of misdeeds that out number ever public address or publicity stunt, even if his wrongs out numbered his rights 50 to 1.

And yet even though his record of lying, cheating, stealing, harassment, and discrimination could construct a wall full of stacked paper, nobody knew the span of the dark side of his empire was just the tip of the iceberg.  One that would be passed down from his father who was once the cities most notorious slumlord often evicting immigrants, people of color, the elderly, veterans, families, the disabled, and really getting a kick out of it when the economy stumbled through economic turmoil, profiting from foreclosures that he would often expedite before the tenant could take any pre-foreclosure actions that could save their home or allow for a better buyer to let them lease or sell the property on more amicable terms. He didn't care. To him, he found the misery of others to be as amusing as a disturbed child torturing a small animal that was already injured.

This was his life. No matter who it was hurting, he was content with it as he was making vacant property to devalue neighborhoods, ruin lives, and when it benefitted him, he would advertise that he was helping the communities he was harming by telling everybody how he wasn't gentrifying, he was "making vacant property sell again".

His life was posh and privilege, much of it wealth bequeathed by his parents and grandparents.  The money came flooding in with every lie he told, all thanks to the ability to brand himself a success when it was really virtual reality, which oddly enough during the several times that virtual reality was a computer fad he never invested any time in, not because he saw it as a passing fad but because he refuses to acknowledge how the technology works though he would spend hours on his phone and on social media.  To speak to him about a scientific like how thermodynamics works (even if you were to present a case that climate change is real), he would reject it even if you could provide an example of scientific concept as part of a public display.  Instead of being that one guy who would shout "FAKE!", he would explain it happened under the same concept as to how professional wrestling is real.  Why accept truths and reject falsehoods when you could state that things are ["kayfabe"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayfabe) and [crystallized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallized_self) [gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting). Basically, operating on two frequencies: conducting himself in a manor that would lull people into buying into it by encouraging them to suspend their beliefs or engaged in manipulating others with thing may or may not be true because you can't determine their validity because your imagination has been turned to mush and what certain potential is processed as absurd nonsense while you process irrational absurdities to be unconditional certainties even if they can be tested for contradiction.

The latest person to be suckered into buying one of his more scrupulous properties was Curtis Williams, a war veteran looking for some peace.  It seemed like an abandon building would be ideal for calming his nerves and PTSD.  The nearest neighbor was two blocks in any direction.

So to have the peace of his own building and to acquire it in a foreclosure with his salary was something he could not pass up...or at least he thought.

The thing about ghosts is that it takes a certain kind of person to believe in them. They aren't stupid, but desperate. And desperate people want to listen to what they like.  These days they are told that if they are told something they like to hear it must be true and that anything to don't want to hear is fake.  To have your emotions desensitized in one place and over-stimulated in places that don't need such a passionate emotional response.  Are people liberal or conservative based on what political ideologies they support or based on emotion?   We are surrounded by images everyday that rather than creating a discourse for dialog and applying laws that can be agreed upon without partisanship, they are made with lockstep crudeness.

Curtis, like many people who base their support on party rather than policy. Curtis would vote for someone with blatant disregard of their voting record.  Over the past 10 years, he's backed local politicians who say they supported reform in the Department of Veterans Affair in their campaign but presented bills to oppose the things they supported citing "cost overruns" despite the local VA hospital in need for new technology, better staff, and definitely a new building.

It would be a decision that this time he would regret considering his most recent investment.

Curtis was encouraged to move his stuff into the building, even as his contract included a one month trial of living there as part of the contract. Soon his personal effects were scattered through out the building. What he didn't know was that some parts of the building were walled off.  Stamp, his realtor, stated that these areas were partitioned so that further improvements could be made.  Curtis wasn't looking forward to splitting the building with other tenants, but since he would only be there for the month, he agreed to this condition as hopefully nobody else would move in.

The truth was, Stamp was keeping part of the building to himself for storage and office space for his upcoming political campaign.

Over time, Curtis started to notice some of his things being places where they shouldn't.  At first, he though it was because part of the building was in disrepair. The building was fixed up as the landlord wanted to ensure the tenant had no suspicions and that any accusations that they were were a personal attack against him.  Curtis though it being odd that a landlord would feel threated to fix a leaky pipe or leave ask what fuses the fuse box take since the electrical wasn't upgraded to breakers.

Soon Curtis would start to hear voices.  Not the voice of someone who had witnessed the horrors of war but more like chains and slow grinding noises, like if somebody had tossed an entire fish into a blender set at a slow speed.  He checked the building for gas leaks, drafts, or broken windows.  He found nothing.

Two weeks in he started think he saw things in the mirror that weren't there or that shadows would move awkwardly.  Worried for his health, he made a visit to his doctor.  The doctor reported that he was healthy even for a person with PTSD.  

By the third week, He even made set a trap in by chance it was a local vagrant hiding in the house or if it was a mouse living in the walls.  The traps went off, often catching nothing.  Once accidentally snared a stray cat which he decided to adopt.

Near the end of the month, he was convinced that something was in his house, and demanded answers.  So he decided to do something that was unorthodox: A seance.

Curtis was not a spiritual person, however he would not dismiss the idea that in order to invoke a ghost to present itself, he could at least try this.  Using a book he got from the library, he recited a chant to call the spirit forward.  What he didn't expect was the manifestation of a seven foot tall ghost covered in rusty scrap metal and whose gate made a thunderous clanging sound.

Ka-lang! Ka-lang! ***WWWWWWWWRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!***

It was the ghost of Mad McCork! 

McCork's new form was like out of a Clive Barker *Hellraiser* movie.  Covered in protruding scrap metal fused to his burnt flesh, Curtis could not believe what he had done, especially the circumstances. Even more unbelievable is how effortlessly it was that the ghost presented itself.  Perhaps it wasn't the copy of *Raising the Dead for Dingbats* that made it happen. It was McCork's time to reveal himself, and like the many victims he had taken before, he was about to add Curtis to his collection of lost souls in hopes to make himself whole.

Curtis wanted none of that! And ran to the next room and locked the door.  He waited there for a couple of hours while outside it sounded like a hurricane of wailing souls and glowing light.

The next morning, Curtis surveiled what happened.  The ghost had punctured one of the walls that separated Curtis' half of the building from Stamp's half and saw all the items that were in it.

Curtis decided it was time to call Stamp to call off the lease.

Stamp spend two hours on the phone as Stamp's secretary kept saying he wasn't in the office.  Finally, Stamp caved and picked up the phone. Curtis wanted out and he made note of the part of his contract that if for any reason something wasn't right, he could terminate the lease within 30 days of its signing. Today was day 29.

Stamp pleaded with Curtis to reconsider, but Curtis rebuked his counter offer especially with whatever it was outside the room he was hiding in last night.

Stamp agreed to hold his end of the bargain and stated that if Curtis had his stuff out of the building by midnight, he was free to leave the building as-is, so as long as he abided to the non-disclosure agreement.

It was noon, and a storm was coming in.  Curtis had less than 12 hours to move out.

Just as Curtis had started packing, the ghost came back and blacked out the window with some sort of umbrakinesis.  At that point, the time to move out was now.

Living in a haunted tower wouldn't have been such a big deal if the ghost he saw last night didn't have the ability to clone itself through out the domicile and didn't just black out the windows, and wasn't homicidal and covered rusty metal fused to its body.

You are Curtis Williams, you must collect your nerves and collect your things and especially the deed to the building and make it to the parking garage without being grinded up by the vile apparition that was not mentioned at the real estate office so that you can crash the realtors new venture: running for governor on a platform of lies.

If you don't get out before time is up, the ghost will drag you to the sub-basement where the furnace is to dismember you and then steel your soul.
